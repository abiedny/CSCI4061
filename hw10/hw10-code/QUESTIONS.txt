PROBLEM 1 `em_server_mq.c' and `em_server_mq.c'
===============================================

  Examine the source code for `em_server_mq.c' and
  `em_client_mq.c'. Compile and run these codes running the server in
  one terminal with clients in another terminal. You may also try
  `./run_simulation_mq.sh 100' which will start the server and 100
  clients to communicate with it.


A
~

  After gaining familiarity with the code, describe the lines of code
  which are used to create POSIX Message Queues.
  - What specific system calls are used to create/access message queues?
  - Which of the server/clients create message queues?
  - How does this compare to the previous FIFO version in the code pack?


B
~

  Describe the sending and receiving functions used in the server/client
  to interact with message queues.
  - What arguments are required for the sending function?
  - What arguments are required for the receiving function?
  - Does the same data type of message go from client to server as from
    server to client?
  - What are the equivalent send/receive functions in the FIFO version
    of the server?


C
~

  Overall, contrast the protocol and architecture of the POSIX Message
  Queue version of the server/client with the FIFO version studied in
  last week's lab.  Are there any major similarities or difference
  between these two?


PROBLEM 2: The Faulty Server
============================

  Examine the provided `faulty_em_server.c' and `faulty_em_client.c'
  which use POSIX Message Queues for communication.  Compile these via
  `make' and run the server in a terminal with clients in another
  terminal. This should appear to work normally. However,
  `./run_simulation_faulty.sh 100' which will launch the server with 100
  clients will report errors. This problem determines why.


A
~

  Examine the architecture for communication that is used between
  `faulty_em_server.c' and `faulty_em_client.c'.
  - How many message queues are there?
  - What appears to be the protocol for communication?


B
~

  Run the "simulation" script for the faulty server and examine the
  results.
  ,----
  | > ./run_simulation_faulty.sh 100
  `----
  To ease the analysis, the script gives clients the expected email
  associated with each name and the client verifies if it gets the
  correct email or reports and ERROR.

  For small runs such as with 10 clients, there may be no errors but for
  larger runs like 100 there are always errors.

  - Construct an argument as to why the protocol used in this version is
    "faulty" as the name suggests.
  - Is this issue specific to Message Queues or would FIFOs have similar
    problems with the faulty protocol?
  - What concurrency issues are present that are not a problem in the
    previous message queue/FIFO versions of the server/client?
