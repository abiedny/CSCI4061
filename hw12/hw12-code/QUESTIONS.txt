Problem 1 `http_get.c'
======================

  Examine the source code for `http_get.c' and use it to contact a few
  hosts and files such as those shown at the top of the source.  Answer
  the following questions.


A
~

  - What is the full name of the that protocol is being employed?
  - Which port does the server listen on in this protocol?

HTTP over TCP/IP, the server listens on port 80.


B
~

  Describe which system calls are used to find an internet address,
  create a socket, and connect the socket to the found address.

The address is found with getaddrinfo(), the a socket is allocated and setup with socket(), 
and finally, connect() is used to connect the socket itself.


C
~

  In this protocol, which entity, SERVER or CLIENT, sends data first?
  (Though you don't have access to a server code, this should be obvious
  from the structure of the client code).

	The client.


D
~

  Does the protocol work in plain text (human readable) or in binary
  format (harder for humans to read directly).  Show examples/evidence
  to support your answer.

Plain text. The request is setup with snprintf()'s, putting readable text into a buffer ready to send. The response
is also human readable.

E
~

  Many protocols use /headers/ which are meant to convey information
  between the communication programs about the state of the
  communication but are NOT data that a program user would be interested
  in.  Show a few headers which appear in communication and describe
  what you infer their meaning to be.

Content-Type, which tells if the response data is plain text, JSON, XML, etc.
Content-Length, is the length of the response data.
Cache-Control likely sets an expiration timer for broswer cached data about the site.

F
~

  Something folks using `http_get' will notice is that many sites report
  something along the following lines:
  ,----
  | HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
  `----
  This is a common response to redirect requests to new locations of
  sites that have re-arranged.  It is also used to indicate a PROTOCOL
  CHANGE, that standard HTTP is not to be used any more. One will notice
  this when doing

  ,----
  | > http_get www-users.cs.umn.edu /~kauffman/congrads.txt
  `----

  Look for clues in the returned headers as to the new location of the
  page and the new and more complex protocol required to get its
  contents. Report your findings below.

The file moved to https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kauffman/congrads.txt, which is HTTPS instead of HTTP.


Problem 2 `http_get_ssl.c'
==========================

  Examine the source code for `http_get_ssl.c' and use it to contact
  some of the same hosts that you did with `http_get.c'.  Answer the
  following questions.


A
~

  Determine what additional measures `http_get_ssl.c' employs to use a
  secure protocol for communication with a server.  Show the code block
  that accomplishes this (though no explanation is required).

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  // Initialize and set up a secure connection with the SSL library
  OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms();
  SSL_library_init();
  const SSL_METHOD *method = SSLv23_client_method();
  SSL_CTX *ctx = SSL_CTX_new(method);
  SSL *ssl_connection = SSL_new(ctx); 
  assert(ssl_connection != NULL);
  SSL_set_fd(ssl_connection, sockfd);
  SSL_connect(ssl_connection);
  // Setup of SSL is complete. The variable 'ssl_connection' is used
  // like a file descriptor with SSL_write() / SSL_read(). The data
  // transmitted will be automatically encrypted/decrypted.
  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


B
~

  Aside from the code block that is added above to enable secure
  communication, are there any other large changes between `http_get.c'
  and `http_get_ssl.c' to implement the secure communication version?

the SSL_write() and SSL_read() functions are used instead of a normal write() or read() to a socket fd.
